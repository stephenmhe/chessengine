**Prerequisites**
- Python 3 is best when running the code, I used 3.9.2.

**Quick Start**
- Install the python programs above.
- Then on python or Visual Studio Code, run the Chess Engine and then the Chess Main to start your game!

**Credits**
I had taken inspiration and the framework of the code from Eddie Sharick's tutorial on how to create a chess engine in python. After the tutorial, I had built on top of the tutorial code and added my own algorithms and functions.
